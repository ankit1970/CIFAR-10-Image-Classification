# CIFAR-10-Image-Classification
This project explores image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch. It implements and compares a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The models are trained using deep learning techniques, including dropout, activation functions, and optimizers.
